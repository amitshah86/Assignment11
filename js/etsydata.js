Return shipping for any reason is always paid by the purchaser and should be discussed with me prior to sending. Shipping charges are estimated to the best of my ability. If actual shipping costs are more than $2.00 under the estimate, a refund will be promptly issued for the difference. \r\n\r\nIt is the buyer&#39;s responsibility to provide an accurate and correct shipping address. I will address the package exactly with the name and address provided.

If for some reason there is a defect or damage that was not caught and described accurately, please contact me right away and we can work it out. I am a reasonable person, but I will not take items back because you changed your mind. Return shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer. It is important that I am contacted with any issues right away within a day or two of receipt.\r\n\r\nDamages or losses caused in shipping need to be resolved with a claim to the carrier. If an item is damaged in shipping please contact me immediately with a description of the damage along with pictures of the damaged item and pictures of the box and packaging materials. These pictures will be needed in order to file a claim with the carrier. No refunds for damage can be issued without pictures. Please do not discard the box or packing materials until the issue is resolved. Sometimes the post office requires you to bring the packaging in to your closest PO for examination before processing a claim.",

"title": "Pink Sugar* Lotion with Aloe Vera -Cool & Light,  a non-greasy moisturizer",
"description": "Pink Sugar* (*Compare to Aquolina)- Aloe Lotion-Non-Greasy- Great for parched summer skin-all skin types especially oily skin.  Comes in an 8 oz. bottle with flip top lid ( not pictured).\n\nThis is my most requested scent so here it is folks. But, I do have a limited supply.\nThe SCENT here is what people are saying about the fragrance Pink Sugar (Aquolina): &quot;It made the list of the top 10 perfumes at Sephora almost immediately, and is still firmly entrenched in the top 5. Pink Sugar, in case you couldn’t guess by the name, is geared towards a relatively young market, and promises to “take you on a journey through the pleasures and flavors of childhood with a playful blend of vanilla and caramel.&quot; Other notes include bergamot, Sicilian orange, raspberry, fig leaves, lily of the valley, licorice, strawberry, red fruit, barbe-a-papa (cotton candy), musk, sandalwood, tonka bean and powdery notes.&quot;\n__________________________\nFEEDBACK-&quot;I am in love with that lotion sample&quot;\n\n&quot;The lotion arrived quickly and was well packed. I absolutely love this scent. It is subtle, light and a mood lifter. The lotion is something I will not do without because of its moisturizing ability, even in the winter. Would give it 10 stars :)&quot;\n\n&quot;Great stuff. And healing ...healed a rash I had on my legs that nothing would get rid of...this got rid of it on days!&quot;\n\n&quot;Awesome Pink Sugar dupe and fast shipping! Glad I discovered your shop, thanks.&quot;\n\n&quot;Perfect smells just like the original!!&quot;\n_______________________\n\n\ncontains: aloe vera,, purified water, vitamin E, Fragrance oil,preservative (formaldyhye and paraben- FREE)",

You receive.25 oz in a beautiful jar. Makes a great gift too. Enjoy!\n_______________\nFEEDBACK:&quot;Im a chapstick junkie and this is one of the BEST I have found....stays on forever!!&quot;\n\nFEEDBACK: &quot;I&#39;ve been using high-end lip balms by Burt&#39;s Bees and Alba, but these are better--and less expensive.&quot;\n_______________\nI learned that most lip balms are made with alcohol, I decided to make my own. Read a typical lip balm label sometime, I did, most contain alcohol, a drying agent. Did you ever wonder why your lips NEED more and more lip balm, you can&#39;t go without it? That&#39;s why, you put it on, your lips dry out, you put more on...a vicious cycle and one that makes them a lot of money!\n\nOur Lip Balm & Gloss is made from the finest ingredients from the local health food store & other fine sources. It is the only lip balm you will need to use for your dry thirsty lips any time of the year.\n\nALL my products are IN STOCK and will be shipped out quickly.I not only pride myself on quality products but customer service as well.",

They&#39;re super cute and fit perfectly into the chest. I was bummed that I didn&#39;t order any for me but upon opening, discovered that an extra bag of mixed ruppees was thrown in with another sample bar, which made my morning. I can&#39;t wait to use them. twootie is an absolute doll, and I will definitely be bringing my business back to the shop!&quot; -Rogue Silver ✿✿✿\r\n\r\n✧✧ &quot;Loved my 1st set so much I bought another once I ran out. It smells like candy yumminess & leaves your skin very soft. Quick shipping, great communication, lovely items, & seller is just wonderful. &lt;3 &quot; - Holly Williams ✧✧\r\n\r\n✿✿ &quot;As a Disney lover I was so excited to get this in! My husband loved it too! We only used half in our garden tub, and had so many bubbles. My bathroom still smells like heaven!!!&quot; - smoothselling07 ✿✿\r\n\r\n✧✧✧ &quot;I&#39;ve ordered from Twootie Tarte many times now and I&#39;ve never been disappointed! From bath bombs to bubble bars, she really knows her stuff and has made some of the best scents I&#39;ve ever used in my baths. I&#39;m always happy to receive her thank you notes and free samples; everything is always packaged so adorably. Thank you for all your hard work and I look forward to enjoying more of your products in the future!&quot; - Megg Landry ✧✧✧\r\n\r\n✿ &quot;Super awesome products!!

The files will not open in any program until they have been extracted from the compressed .ZIP file. \r\n.............................................\r\nQ: How do I open a .zip file?\r\n\r\nA: You will need an extraction program to unzip or open your files. There are many different programs available, we recommend WinZip (for PC users) or StuffIt Expander (for Mac users). If you are on a iphone or ipad you will need a free third party app to open .zip documents such as Winzip or izip.\r\n.............................................\r\n\r\nQ: My download says it’s empty, damaged, corrupt or password protected?\r\n\r\nA: Your product probably didn’t download properly. Delete the .zip file from your computer (emptying your recycle bin as well), clear your temporary internet files and try again. If you still have problems convo us.\r\n.............................................\r\n\r\nQ: Why does my image have a white background behind it?\r\n\r\nA: Each clipart and stamp folder comes with two versions of each clipart image, a JPG and a PNG format. If you have placed your image in your program and it has the white background, then you are using the JPG file. The PNG file will have a transparent background behind your image.       \r\n\r\n.............................................\r\n\r\nQ: My images or previews are blank, white?\r\n\r\nA: If the clipart color is white then it will look blank in the preview image, once it is opened you will see the white clipart on a transparent background. \r\n\r\nIf you have any more questions please convo us.",

Insurance is available for your purchase. \r\n\r\nPlease note that if you purchase several items at once, this may increase the shipping time from what is listed under each item individually.\r\n\r\n*SHIPPING* For a full book, current TURN AROUND TIME is 4-6 weeks BEFORE shipping unless otherwise stated on the item listing. Books are shipped via USPS Priority Mail and usually take between 2-3 days (sometimes longer on the holidays). Smaller orders (less than 6 pages) will be shipped via USPS First Class and can take 3-5 days (longer on holidays). If you need it sooner please let me know before your purchase, and if I feel I am able to get your order done sooner, I will create a RUSH LISTING order for you to purchase. Please order early to ensure you receive your items in a timely manner. When your order ships you will receive a email notification containing the tracking information. \r\n\r\n*SHIPPING INSURANCE* I am responsible for your purchase until it reaches the Post Office. I am not responsible for lost, damaged or mis-delivered packages. I recommend that you purchase shipping insurance. If you would like to insure your package, please let me know, and I will calculate the cost and create a listing for you to purchase it. Insurance is to protect against loss or damage during shipping. If you choose not to buy insurance and your purchase is lost or damaged by USPS, I cannot provide a refund. All purchases are shipped by USPS and insured through USPS (if you choose to purchase insurance).\r\n\r\n*ADDRESS CHANGES* Please note as per Etsy policy I CANNOT make any changes to shipping addresses when the order is placed. Please make sure that your shipping address is entered correctly during check out. If an order is returned due to an incorrect address, you will be required to re-purchase shipping. Thank you for understanding. \r\n\r\n*INTERNATIONAL ORDERS* For International Orders I ship via USPS First Class International. A tracking number CANNOT be provided with this service. My experience tells me that arrival time is 1-4 weeks depending on your location.\r\nIf the total price of your order is more than $100, I strongly recommend upgrading to a fully trackable service. If you would like to upgrade, please let me know and I will create a listing for you to purchase it. To get door-to-door tracking for international orders the shipping method is Express Priority International mail. If you do not upgrade, your package will not be tracked and I will not be held responsible for lost or mis-delivered packages.\r\n\r\n*Any customs taxes or fees due for international packages are to be paid by the buyer.\r\n\r\n*If there is an issue with delivery of package, all claims with USPS must be handled by the buyer.",

"title": "TW-DOFP Wolverine Claws - Brushed Metallic Powder Cast - Comfortable and Easy to Assemble!",
"description": "Don&#39;t forget to add on a set of Wolverine Dog Tags:\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/223365664/wolverine-dog-tags-notched-us-tags-from?ref=shop_home_active_14\n\n\nHere are some hi-res images of the claws. (Open the links below to go to the gallery. If there is an image in the gallery that you want to see at full resolution then right-click on image and select &#39;View Original&#39;).  \n\nTW - DOFP Claws:\nhttps://skydrive.live.com/?cid=21209EBD4D8A434F&id=21209EBD4D8A434F%211767\n\nHi-Def Videos of our claws:\n(You can increase the resolution in the settings)\n\nAssembly Instructions:\nhttp://youtu.be/4DFyksTZRXY\n\nMaintenance Tips:\nhttp://youtu.be/ee5oAbBtfBU\n\nStrength Demonstration:\nhttp://youtu.be/aiCkAaCWto4\n\nWe have been making props since 2006 and started sharing our work with people from all over the world in 2010. We have sent out quite a lot of props and consistently receive positive feedback. We stand behind the quality of our work to ensure that you get the best product we can give you. If you have any questions, before or after your purchase, please feel free to contact us. We are here to help and want to make sure that all questions are answered and that every customer is happy with their purchase.\n\nWe are currently on the third generation of our claw design. We have designed the &#39;TW-DOFP&#39; claws making them as screen accurate as possible.  The &#39;TW-DOFP&#39; claws are 10 inches long, 7/8 inch tall, and 1/4 inch wide.  Each set comes with 6 claws and 2 grips.  \n\nThis set comes with 6 claws and 2 grips. The claws are made from a tinted urethane plastic casting resin and cast with metallic powder and then sealed. The metallic powder is like a paint that is embedded in the surface of the resin so the cast still shows the texture of the original model. Anticipating that, we gave it a brushed stainless steel type texture. The result is beautiful (note: these are not &#39;cold cast&#39; made with real metal).\n\nWe used the same method that was used for the hero and stunt props with the claws attached to wires and then to a grip. You can see the wires in some of the promo shots they did. They are also fully adjustable so that they can be customized to fit different sized hands. This will minimize the amount of wire that is visible and any gaps that you may otherwise get with those generic pre-assembled claws. The height is adjusted by the location of the bend in the wire and the grips are adjustable via two screws which allow you to move the claws closer or farther away from your hand. It is better if you fit the claws to your hands yourself if you are capable since that is the best way to get a perfect fit. We made a guide to show you how to assemble them in the video links at the top of the description. \n\nWe do also offer a fitting service where we&#39;ll tailor fit and pre-assemble the claws for you. We will bend all the wires according to measurements that you provide us. Each claw and grip will be marked for it&#39;s location. The claws will be shipped in the disassembled form but putting them back together will be effortless. Once you reassemble the claws you will most likely have to do some minor adjustments to get the claws to look their best regarding the fit to your hand. If you get this service then you will receive a message that will show you what measurements we need. \n\nYou have the option to select either resin/plastic or metal grips.  The resin/plastic grips are softer and, while they work well, they will not last as long as the metal grips.The metal grips are sturdier.  They hold the claws better because both the grips and the wires are metal so they can really clamp down on the metal wire.    Furthermore, the metal grips make the assembly process even faster and easier than with the resin grips.\n\nWe also offer extra individual claws for sale. Some people may want to buy a few extra claws at the time of purchase and save on shipping costs since we combine shipping on multiple purchases. Some may need to come back and purchase a claw as a replacement. In any case, if you want to add some extra claws on to your order or if you need to get a replacement claw for a set you already purchased then just send us a custom order request (link located under the images above).\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Though the claws have no sharpened edge, they come to a semi-sharp point (such as that found on a plastic fork) and should be used with caution. The claws are for decorative purposes only.\n\nDark Matter Forge, Dark Matter Props, DarkMatterProps.com, it owners, managers, and the person or persons financially, physically, partially or wholly involved in the intended operations of Darkmatterprops.com and any other related social media and/or retail sites can and will hereby be referred to in the plural sense such as &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;we&quot;.
